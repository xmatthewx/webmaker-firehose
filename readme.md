# Webmaker

Webmaker enables people to discover, create, and share rich content from their mobile device. It brings a few of the webâ€™s best ingredients to a mobile-first content creation platform. Webmaker goes beyond a soundbite or filtered photo to enable truly creative projects. It is free, open-source, and independent.

Webmaker is currently available in the Android Play store. Projects can be shared and viewed from any web browser on mobile or desktop.
